abstract = {Intersatellite links or crosslinks provide direct connectivity between two or more satellites, thus eliminating the need for intermediate ground stations when sending data. Intersatellite links have been considered for satellite constellation missions involving earth observation and communications. Historically, a large satellite system has needed an extremely high financial budget. However, the advent of the successful CubeSat platform allows for small satellites of less than one kilogram. This low-mass pico-satellite class platform could provide financially feasible support for large platform satellite constellations. This article surveys past and planned large intersatellite linking systems. Then, the article chronicles CubeSat communication subsystems used historically and in the near future. Finally, we examine the history of inter-networking protocols in space and open research issues with the goal of moving towards the next generation intersatellite-linking constellation supported by CubeSat platform satellites.},

abstract = {The increasing demands of position information have made the wireless location technology catch more and more attention nowadays. GPS (Global Positioning System) which has been widely used cannot localize successfully indoors and among buildings, its defects are increasingly prominent. Given the acceptable terrestrial digital television signals anytime and anywhere, as well as the advantages of high transmission power, low operating frequency and strict synchronization with absolute time, it is possible to achieve accurate positioning by Digital Television Terrestrial Multimedia Broadcasting (DTMB) and GPS. Electromagnetic waves have to propagate by deflection, refraction and scattering because of the obstructions in the surroundings of transmitting, we call it as Non-Line of Sight (NLOS) propagation, which results in NLOS errors [1]. In this paper we take some further study on the method of NLOS error mitigation based on the hybrid positioning system combining DTMB and GPS in view of a large number of obstacles in the urban environment. This algorithm, referred to as Range Dynamic Compensation and Linear Line of Position Joint Algorithm, can predict the next position of the object, which can be used to compensate the actual measured value for the purpose of reducing the NLOS errors. The Linear Line of Position Algorithm which utilizes the linear statistical location techniques straightforward rather than linearizing the system roughly is then applied to simplify the position coordinates calculations as well as mitigate the residual NLOS errors. The simulation testing result indicates that this joint algorithm significantly improved the location precision in areas with serious NLOS contamination. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag GmbH.},

abstract = {This project explores Worcester Polytechnic Institute's (WPI) initial venture in experimenting with a type of picosatellite called a CubeSat. Three Major Qualifying Projects (MQP) representing seven subsystems collaborated on the construction of a ground-based CubeSat to test current technologies and investigate the feasibility of future CubeSat projects at WPI. Of the seven CubeSat subsystems, this report outlines efforts of the power, propulsion, and structure subsystems. Research on previous and current CubeSat projects provided baseline information, giving teams the ability to select components for a “Lab Option” as well as “Flight Option” CubeSat. Although construction and testing of a full Lab Option CubeSat was beyond the scope of this project, each of the three subsystems teams were able to design and/or construct a baseline set of components for their subsystem and perform rudimentary testing. The extensive research and recommendations detailed herein will be used by future groups to prepare a space-ready satellite. In addition, this project (in conjunction with two other CubeSat design teams) resulted in a fully defined Flight Option CubeSat, including component selection and mission planning, for a 3U CubeSat carrying an Infrared Spectrometer},
