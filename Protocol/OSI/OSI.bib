abstract = {This reference model provides a common basis for the coordination of standards development for the purpose of systems interconnection, while allowing existing standards to be placed into perspective within the overall reference model. It also identifies areas for developing and improving standards and provides a common reference for maintaining consistency among all related standards. The text was developed jointly with ISO/IEC and the main intent of this revision is to introduce the joint text, which incorporates inclusion of the concept of connectionless transmission, in addition to a number of technical and editorial refinements.},
