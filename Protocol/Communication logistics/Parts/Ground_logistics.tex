At first, when a client wants to contract our service he/she will have to descrive as the orbital and technical characteristics of its satellite. Then he/she has to ask for downloaging data of its satellite. This application will be sended, by internet, to the nearest to the satellite Ground Station. If we have GS in Terrassa, Beijing and Lima and the saellite its over Mexico, the application will be send to Lima GS, wherever the client is.
\paragraph{}
When the application arrives to the GS it will code it according to the communication protocol. This coded application will include where is the client's satellite and in what GS has to be downloaded the data. It will not include the path.

When the information is downloaded to the GS, it will be decodified and sended to the client. It will be also done by internet
