abstract = {Started in 1999, the CubeSat Project began as a collaborative effort between Prof. Jordi Puig-Suari at California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly), San Luis Obispo, and Prof. Bob Twiggs at Stanford University's Space Systems Development Laboratory (SSDL). The purpose of the project is to provide a standard for design of picosatellites to reduce cost and development time, increase accessibility to space, and sustain frequent launches. Presently, the CubeSat Project is an international collaboration of over 100 universities, high schools, and private firms developing picosatellites containing scientific, private, and government payloads. A CubeSat is a 10 cm cube with a mass of up to 1.33 kg. Developers benefit from the sharing of information within the community. If you are planning to start a CubeSat project, please contact Cal Poly. Visit the CubeSat website at http://cubesat.org for more information.},

@article{Cote2011,
abstract = {This project explores Worcester Polytechnic Institute's (WPI) initial venture in experimenting with a type of picosatellite called a CubeSat. Three Major Qualifying Projects (MQP) representing seven subsystems collaborated on the construction of a ground-based CubeSat to test current technologies and investigate the feasibility of future CubeSat projects at WPI. Of the seven CubeSat subsystems, this report outlines efforts of the power, propulsion, and structure subsystems. Research on previous and current CubeSat projects provided baseline information, giving teams the ability to select components for a “Lab Option” as well as “Flight Option” CubeSat. Although construction and testing of a full Lab Option CubeSat was beyond the scope of this project, each of the three subsystems teams were able to design and/or construct a baseline set of components for their subsystem and perform rudimentary testing. The extensive research and recommendations detailed herein will be used by future groups to prepare a space-ready satellite. In addition, this project (in conjunction with two other CubeSat design teams) resulted in a fully defined Flight Option CubeSat, including component selection and mission planning, for a 3U CubeSat carrying an Infrared Spectrometer},
