abstract = {"In a world where the number of people who need to learn about data communications and networking is exploding, Forouzan's book is the answer. The book's visual approach makes it easy for students to learn about and understand the concepts involved in this rapidly developing field.. ." "TCP/IP Protocol Suite teaches students and professionals, with no prior knowledge of TCP/IP everything they need to know about the subject. This comprehensive book uses hundreds of figures to make technical concepts easy to grasp as well as many examples which help tie the material to the real-world.. ." "The fourth edition of TCP/IP Protocol Suite has been fully updated to include all of the recent technology changes in the field. Additionally, out-of-date material has been overhauled to reflect recent changes in technology."--Back cover.},
