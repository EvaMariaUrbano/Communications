\section{Generalities}
\paragraph{}
The satellite constellation has to be done in a series of
polar, or near polar, orbits where all planes move in the same direction. In general this configuration allows, in general, a easy comunication in the mesh and a global coverage.
\paragraph{} 
This will create two hemispheres where in one the satellites move from south to north, and in the other one they move from north to south. If there were two adjacent planes moving in opposite directions, the relative velocity of the satellites will be very high, and its relative position will also vary significantly, almost covering 180ยบ. It has to be  also considered the Doppler Efect due the high relative velocities. 
\paragraph{}
Trying to comunicate directly from one hemispher to the other will take lots of resources, principaly in terms of power, weigh and space in the sats. It has to be implemented a tracking antena and a system which can filtter the Doppler Efect in the signal
\paragraph{}
This two hemisferes are communicatted in the poles. But transmiting the signal to a concret Ground Station could represent a long and ineficient path.
